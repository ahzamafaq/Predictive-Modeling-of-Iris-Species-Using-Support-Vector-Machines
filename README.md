# Predictive-Modeling-of-Iris-Species-Using-Support-Vector-Machines
The goal of this project is to utilize Support Vector Machines (SVM) to accurately classify the species of Iris flowers based on their physical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. By analyzing this data, we aim to build a robust predictive model that can distinguish between the three species with high accuracy.
